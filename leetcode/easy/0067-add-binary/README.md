## Problem

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return  *their sum as a binary string*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
- a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
